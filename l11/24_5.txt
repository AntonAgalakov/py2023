There are several sports, and this is not the only one. You can do this at the gym,
but this time you can do it outdoors. I am talking about golf, in fact. The sun is
good for the game of golf. It gives more energy to your body and your heart, which is
one of the important parts of your body. So just imagine. If you have a long day at work
with a lot of work, you arrive home at night and you go directly to bed. And then you sleep until morning.
Animals are in danger all over the world.
Some animals are in danger because people want to wear their fur. Others, like elephants,
are killed for their tusks which become necklaces and decorations. But many animals are in
danger because man is destroying their environment - cutting down forests, building roads and
houses or polluting the places where these animals live.
There are two types of elephant in the world: the African elephant and the Indian elephant
It is quite easy to tell the difference between the two because they don't look the same.
The African elephant has bigger ears than the Indian elephant, and the Indian elephant's legs
are shorter. Both types of elephant use their trunks to lift things and are as strong as each other.
Elephants are faster than you would think and are more intelligent than many other animals.
